# Python Scripts

# Intorduction

- Python script is our backend to crawl the weekly top 10 videos.

- Python script also send the newsletters to the subscribers every week.

- We allow the Python scripts to be standalone without websites.

# Techniques

We listed the libraries and service we used.

- [Python3](https://python.org)
- [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) -- a sending newsletters service
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) -- our database

# Prerequisite

We listed the steps to show how to build the cron Python scripts.

We assume that the targeted Operating system is Ubuntu 16.04.
So we need to run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
# The Python3 has already installed on Ubuntu 16.04, but the pip is not.
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# Install the required Python libraries via pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

# Installation

# TODO
